        \item Each feature branch can only be merged into the master branch via a pull request
        \item Each pull request must be at least approved by at least two members
        \item Github Actions CI to auto test new pull requests
    \end{itemize}
	\item Issues: \begin{itemize}
	    \item Tasks will be placed into issues board based on priority, type and technology
        \item Issue Types:

            \item P2: Will be addressed whenever there is no higher priority items available
        \end{itemize}
        \item Issues will be prioritized on a bi-weekly basis during scrum meetings
        \item Use Github Project board, to rearrange issues and assign task
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

% What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
% demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
% you will be able to overcome this risk?

% old
% Our main risk is not knowing if our back-end server will be able to handle multiple concurrent compilations at the same time.

% We will demonstrate running a multiplayer game with concurrent compilation of programs, as the multiplayer aspect is the core of the project.

% new

% Risk?

Our main risk is not knowing if our back-end server can execute given code and evaluate it for correction for a set problem.

We will demonstrate that a front-end can communicate with a back-end server to compile code, compute and return results based on evaluation against set test cases. The front-end will show a code editor with syntax highlighting, a basic homepage, as well as problem descriptions. The front-end will also call the back end for a list of problems against a problems API to demonstrate that we can effectively store and retrieve problems.

The demonstration will also show a documentation page to show diligence in knowledge transfer.
