\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

Practicing coding the traditional way can be daunting. The current most popular method to learn is to use a problem database site like \href{http://www.leetcode.com}{LeetCode}. This method of learning can often feel tiring and endless. There are over 2000 problems on the website which can be intimidating to many new coders. CodeChamp will introduce a collaborative and fun way to interact with your friends while improving your algorithmic skills.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues} 
\begin{itemize} 
    \item Judging and evaluation of a user submission
    \item Safety, managing malicious code submissions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
N/A

\subsection{New Problems}
N/A

\subsection{Tasks}

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
N/A

\subsection{Risks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multiple concurrent communications between front-end and back-end
    \item Back-end server may not be able to handle multiple concurrent of compilation
    \item Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks
    \item Malicious code injections
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Costs}

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
For concurrent communications and concurrent code compilations, vertical scaling for hardware is an easy fast method to remove the limitations of concurrency. However this leads to future higher costs. Load balancing can be used to allow for horizontal scaling of system.

For costs, many options exists for free/hobby tier project hosting, allowing for cost savings.

\section{Appendix}

This section has been added to the Volere template.  This is where you can place
additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the requirements will likely call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.
